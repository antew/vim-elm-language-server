Or, you can configure ALE to use a globally installed version for all executables.

```

```

You can set the path to `elm` and `elm-format` if desired, it defaults to assuming `elm` and `elm-format` are avilable on the `$PATH`.

let g:ale_elm_ls_elm_format_path = "/path/to/elm-format"
let g:ale_elm_ls_elm_path = "/path/to/elm"
```
